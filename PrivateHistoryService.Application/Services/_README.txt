This directory is responsible for defining service interfaces that encapsulate various functionalities and operations related to reading and 
writing data. This directory promotes separation of concerns and modularity by abstracting the implementation details of these services from 
the rest of the application.
-------------------------
Structure of the Services Directory
The Services directory is organized into two subdirectories:
* ReadServices
	The ReadServices subdirectory contains service interfaces responsible for operations related to reading or querying data from the application's
	data sources. These interfaces define methods for retrieving data without modifying the application's state and extend beyond the 
	basic CRUD operations provided by repository interfaces for domain entities. 
* WriteServices
	The WriteServices subdirectory contains service interfaces responsible for operations related to creating, updating, or deleting data within 
	the application. These interfaces define methods for modifying the application's state and persisting changes to the underlying data sources. 
	These methods are additional to the basic CRUD operations provided by repository interfaces for domain entities. 
-------------------------
Responsibilities of Service Interfaces
Service interfaces within the Services directory define methods that encapsulate specific functionalities or operations within the application. 
These interfaces serve as contracts that define the expected behavior and functionality of the corresponding service implementations and are 
tailored to provide operations that are ADDITIONAL to the basic entity operations defined in repository interfaces. 
By abstracting service functionalities behind interfaces, the problem of ever-growing repository interfaces is prevented, promoting modularity, 
testability, and flexibility within the application.
