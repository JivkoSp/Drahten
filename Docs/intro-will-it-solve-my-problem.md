# Will This Product Solve My Problem?

If you are looking for a secure application framework that provides robust access control, reliable information retrieval, and strong data encryption, **Drahten** is designed to meet those needs. By leveraging a **microservices architecture**, Drahten ensures that each service is isolated and secure, while the use of an authentication server and reverse proxy server provides centralized user authentication and authorization. Additionally, the encryption of data in transit and the comprehensive logging system contribute to the overall security and transparency of the application.

Moreover, Drahten offers advanced capabilities for scraping information from various websites, performing semantic searches on the retrieved information, and generating questions based on the semantic meaning of the data. This is achieved through a custom search engine implemented by the project. These features enable efficient data retrieval and analysis, making Drahten an excellent choice for applications requiring intelligent data processing and query generation.

While no system can guarantee "absolute security," Drahten aims to provide "sufficient security" to protect your data and maintain the integrity of your application.
