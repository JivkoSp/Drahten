# Containerization

## Using Docker for developing microservice applications has the following advantages

* **Enhanced Security and Isolation** - Docker containers have strong isolation from each other and from the host machine, thereby preventing unauthorized access and interference.
  In the context of Docker containers, “strong isolation” means they are strictly separated from each other and the host machine, preventing unauthorized access and interference.
  This is important for data security and communication between services in a microservice application. Subsequently, additional security updates can be added to a service running in a Docker container without
  affecting the rest of the application;

* **Improved Performance and Efficiency** - Docker containers can be dynamically scaled "up" or "down" according to load and demand using tools like [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/)
   and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). This allows for more optimal resource utilization compared to virtual machines and reduces costs. Docker containers can run in parallel and simultaneously without interfering with each other.
  This means they can handle multiple requests and tasks concurrently, increasing the application's performance;

* **Simplified and Standardized Development Environment** - Using Docker, a reliable, consistent, and reproducible environment can be created for each service comprising a microservice application,
  regardless of the programming languages, frameworks, or libraries used. This reduces the risk of compatibility issues and configuration changes between different environments.
