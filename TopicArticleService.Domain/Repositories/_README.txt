This directory contains interfaces that define the allowed actions and operations with domain entities. 
These interfaces serve as contracts or blueprints for data access and manipulation operations. The primary purpose of these interfaces is to 
abstract away the specific implementation details of data storage and retrieval, allowing for flexibility, maintainability, and testability 
within the application.
